			<h1>Julia Gao</h1>
      <p>I'm a software developer at O.C. Tanner. I like learning new languages, including
        (but not limited to): Elm, Om-Next, PureScript, German, Japanese, ...
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also a student at University of Utah, pursuing Bachelor of Computer Science. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not working, doing homework, or learning things, I like to play video games (3DS and PC).
      </p>
      <p>
        Things I want to get better at is not getting that nervous at public speaking, and I'm always looking for opportunities to speak at conferences.
